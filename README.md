### A More General, More Straightforward, and More Creative Framework for Conjoint Analysis

---

**projoint** is a package to estimate Average Marginal Component Effects (AMCEs) or Marginal Means (MMs) based on a conjoint survey experiment. It produces more reliable estimates after correcting measurement error bias than other packages for conjoint analysis. Furthermore, it presents a more general framework so that researchers can answer a range of substantively important questions more straightforwardly.


Some notes:

* The current version assumes that the outcome variable is a binary forced choice.

* This package is still under construction. We plan to make the first release by the end of July 2023.


## Installation

You can install the development version of **projoint** from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:
