To-Do List for projoint R library

Necessary for First Release
1) Add input argument to allow tau to be either specified or estimated
	a) When a specific tau is given, add noise via the SD of the binomial dist (more conservative SEs)
2) Vignette
	a) A data set with a repeated task
	b) A data set that is a Qualtrics csv that has NO repeated task (to show how to specify tau)
3) Documentation
	a) Expand upon the roxygen descriptions with the above vignettes
	b) Note that weights, interactions, hettx coming soon
4) Unit tests
	a) Figure out this -- maybe I can hire an RA
5) pkgdown
	a) Pages explaining how to set up JS/php using Anton's software
	b) How to set up a repeated task in Qualtrics
	c) How to estimate
	d) Explanation of how some of our code fixes bugs in cj etc
6) Automatic plotting
7) Functionality for users to specify attribute orders, level orders, base categories
   (better than cjoint) Prints out:
Default,AttributeLevel,NewOrder
1,att1:level1,
2,att1:level2,

Then users say dat$NewOrder = c(2,1,3,4,5)

OR

users can save as csv and add in the column manually, then read back into R


Future Versions
1) Adding weights (as per Kosuke's paper) -- do we have a data set with weights we can test with?
	a) Read Kosuke & Naoki's paper again and find the data he uses
	b) https://imai.fas.harvard.edu/research/conjoint.html
2) Interaction effects
3) Heterogeneous effects?
