## **Why Correct for Measurement Error?**

In conjoint experiments, **measurement error** is pervasive but often overlooked.Respondents may:

- Misread attributes
- Misunderstand levels
- Click randomly
- Forget information across tasks

As a result, even if a respondent has **true preferences**, their recorded choices are often **noisy reflections** of those preferences. This **random error** introduces a severe **bias toward zero** â€” meaning **estimated effects are systematically too small**.

## **The Consequences of Ignoring Measurement Error**

| Without Correction             | With Correction                  |
|:--------------------------------|:----------------------------------|
| Underestimates true preference differences | Reveals true magnitude of effects |
| Falsely suggests indifference | Recovers meaningful trade-offs |
| Misleads theory building and application | Provides accurate, unbiased insights |

## **How projoint Corrects for Measurement Error**

- **Estimates the intra-respondent reliability (IRR)** using a repeated task
- **Adjusts marginal means (MMs) and average marginal component effects (AMCEs)** accordingly
- **Provides corrected estimates** that are closer to respondentsâ€™ true underlying preferences

âœ… No additional respondent burden (just one repeated task)  
âœ… Minimal survey design changes  
âœ… Massive improvements in accuracy

## **Key Takeaway**

> ðŸ§  Measurement error systematically *biases* results.  
> 
> ðŸ”¥ Correcting for measurement error reveals true preferences, sharper trade-offs, and prevents misleading inferences.
