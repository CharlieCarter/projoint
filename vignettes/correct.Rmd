## **Why Correct for Measurement Error?**

- In conjoint experiments, **measurement error** is pervasive but often overlooked.  
- Respondents may:
  - Misread attributes
  - Misunderstand levels
  - Click randomly
  - Forget information across tasks
- As a result, respondents' recorded choices often refelect random noise.   
- This **random error** leads to attenuate **true prefernces** (or true effects).

## **The Consequences of Ignoring Measurement Error**

| Without Correction             | With Correction                  |
|:--------------------------------|:----------------------------------|
| Underestimates true preferences | Provides more accurate preferences |
| Falsely suggests indifference | Recovers meaningful trade-offs |
| Misleads theory building and application | Provides accurate, unbiased insights |

## **How projoint Corrects for Measurement Error**

- **Estimates the intra-respondent reliability (IRR)** based on responses to a repeated task
- **Adjusts marginal means (MMs) and average marginal component effects (AMCEs)** accordingly
- **Provides corrected estimates** that better reflect respondentsâ€™ true preferences
- Corrected estimates reveal the true magnitude of effects, **improving both theoretical and applied inferences** in political science, marketing, and other fields.

âœ… No additional respondent burden (just one repeated task)  
âœ… Minimal survey design changes  
âœ… Massive improvements in accuracy

## **Key Takeaway**

> ðŸ§  Measurement error systematically *biases* results.  
> 
> ðŸ”¥ Correcting for measurement error reveals true preferences, sharper trade-offs, and prevents misleading inferences.
