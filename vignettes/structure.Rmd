## **Why Choice-Level Analysis?**

In traditional conjoint analysis, researchers typically estimate **profile-level** quantities, treating each profile independently. This approach has become the standard, particularly after the influential work of Hainmueller, Hopkins, and Yamamoto (2014).

However, **profile-level analysis can systematically miss how people actually make decisions**.

**Key Issues:**

- When individuals compare two profiles side-by-side (as in most conjoint tasks), their evaluations are often **psychologically influenced by the alternative**.
- Profile-level quantities like AMCEs may be **biased toward indifference**, masking the **true tradeoffs** that respondents are making.

Thus, **analyzing profiles independently** â€” without considering the context of comparison â€” can **distort** our understanding of decision-making.

## **Why Move to Choice-Level Analysis?**

**Choice-level analysis** models the decision **between two profiles**, not the evaluation of a single profile.

This approach better reflects:

- How people make real-world tradeoffs (e.g., choosing between candidates, products, policies)
- How comparative contexts influence judgments (e.g., assimilation, contrast effects)

Instead of estimating the probability of selecting a standalone profile, choice-level analysis estimates **the likelihood of choosing one profile over another**, given their attributes.

âœ… **Better matches real-world behavior**  
âœ… **Explicitly captures comparative decision-making**  
âœ… **Reveals true tradeoffs and feature prioritization**

## **Summary**

| Profile-Level Analysis | Choice-Level Analysis |
|:-----------------------|:----------------------|
| Treats profiles independently | Models the decision between profiles |
| Ignores comparative psychology | Captures influence of side-by-side comparisons |
| May blur or bias tradeoffs | Highlights real tradeoffs |
| Easier but can be misleading | Slightly more complex but much more informative |

## **Key Takeaway**

> ðŸ”Ž If your conjoint design presents two profiles for comparison, **choice-level analysis is essential for valid and insightful inference**.  
> 
> ðŸ“ˆ It provides **deeper insights**, **more accurate estimates**, and a **closer reflection of real-world decision-making**.
