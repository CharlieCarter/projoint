If an area has a commute time of only 10 minutes or so for shopping, etc., it sounds like a suburb, not a rural community. That’s just my opinion. I’d rather live in a suburb of a suburb, if that makes sense. I don’t care how many whites, blacks, etc. live there. I’d like to live where housing costs are low, crime rate is low, commute time is low.  That is probably too much to ask.
