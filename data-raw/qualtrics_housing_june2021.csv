Sounds horrible.
And in a way it is. But it's funny how the people that claim to support the plight of the poor live in the best parts of Brooklyn and actually KICKED OUT the minorities that lived there.
I'm a moderate conservative. 
I grew up lower income so that is ironic, I guess.

My friend was finally able to save up enough to find a place that was not low-income.

While I realize the great need in our cities for this housing I have also lived near housing projects and section 8 homes.  I have seen middleclass neighborhoods dropped a level downward in livability when such 100% low income housing is built in the middle of them.  

It relates to  elementary schools having children who have behavioral problems being placed in the schools from the projects.  In my neighborhood school there were increased acts of violence and in one instance a 3rd grade boy simulating sex with a little girl on the playground,  Theft of items from the homes increased and parks were vandalized.  

This wasn't a racial situation but rather broken families bringing their social problems with them when they moved in.  Not all residents but enough caused problems that the neighborhood was affected.  I'm not sure how society handles the problem of poverty but I walked away with a feeling  that at least a large number of residents should be not low income in apartment buildings to give a modicum of stability and watchful eyes.

I  inherited a mobile home from my parents and remodeled it to live in for the rest of my life. It is in a large senior mobile home park that was very nice. Then 8 years ago the family that had owned the park for 80 years sold it to a predatory property developer from California . The  space rent is now skyrocketing and they do NO maintenance on the park and it is falling into ruin. Their goal is to starve us out , force all of us elderly people  onto the streets  and then  demolish the parks and build section 8 apartments to house the millions of illegal aliens that are flooding into Oregon as we are a sanctuary state. Too bad we aren't a sanctuary for elderly AMERICAN citizens . I will not be starved out of my home and will take my own life when the time comes. I think I've got about  6 to 8 years left before the rent becomes too high for me to survive. I'd rather be dead than be on the streets at the age of 75. I am healthy and active and could make it to 100, but I know I won't , due to this horror of greed and political corruption that IS  life in Oregon state now . So be it .
